|:---:|:---:|---
[Link](https://github.com/IliaTsitovich/Books-market-on-API-Google-Books)|[Servise GitHub API](https://iliatsitovich.github.io/Project-with-API-GitHub)|I divided the project implementation into stages. I assessed the complexity of each stage. I determined the order of their execution. I implemented various states depending on the search results and user wait times. I used functional components. Challenges: Implementing pagination for the list of repositories and their loading. Technologies ***Typescript, CSS, REACT+Vite, Github API, Fetch***
[Link](https://github.com/IliaTsitovich/React-App-Kanban-board)|[Kanban-board REACT](https://iliatsitovich.github.io/React-App-Kanban-board/)| I assessed the stages of work, analyzed the technical specifications and project design mockup. I implemented the ability to add “new tasks” in the section block and created connections between blocks for moving tasks through their stages. I implemented the ability to view the description of each task, and the ability to edit and save it. Challenges: Implementing the ability to edit the description section of each task and save the changes. Main Technologies: ***React, useState, useContext, Provider, SCSS***
[Link](https://github.com/IliaTsitovich/Books-market-on-API-Google-Books)|[Books-Market](https://IliaTsitovich.github.io/Books-market-on-API-Google-Books)| I assessed the complexity and order of project implementation. Based on the design mockup, I implemented the project. I used a slider to display information blocks in the project. Using the Google Books API, I implemented the display of book sections and their information cards. I simulated adding items to the cart and saving the result of the item selection in the cart. I added responsive design. Main Technologies: ***JS, REST-API, Webpack, SCSS***
[Link](https://github.com/IliaTsitovich/Project-Slider)|[Slider JS](https://iliatsitovich.github.io/Project-Slider)| I created a website based on a design mockup and used JavaScript to implement an image slider. I also implemented responsive design for various devices. Main Technologies: ***HTML, SCSS, JavaScript***
